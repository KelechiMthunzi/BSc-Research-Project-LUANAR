The decision to chooose what topic to study for my desertation came when my interest in modelling was developing,
so l deliberately went for a topic which would help me not only develop a working mode, but something which l could present for peoples review.
The Objective was to build a model that used Neural Networks, machine learning argorithms, Long short term memory(LSTM) to be specific.
So the files consist of the proporsal, the project and the code.
